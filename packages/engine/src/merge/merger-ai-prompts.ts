FN-8004 follow-up. The prompt tells the reviewer to "End with a single decision line", so a
compliant reviewer writes its reasoning ABOVE `REVIEW_VERDICT: reject` and ends on the verdict.
This function only scanned lines AFTER the verdict line, so those reasons were discarded and the
rejection degraded to the placeholder "rejected the merge without a stated reason" — which was then
handed to the corrective re-merge pass as its instruction. The corrective pass thus received no
actionable feedback and merely re-rolled the merge, which typically passed on the next review.

Observed on FN-8004's own merge: BOTH attempts went reject(no reason) → corrective pass → approve,
burning ~7 min per cycle and pushing each attempt past main's ~8-min churn window into a livelock.
That is a lost-reason bug, not a reviewer that genuinely objects twice and then relents.

Reason precedence: inline (same line as the verdict) → lines after the verdict → lines before it
(nearest-first, the "End with the verdict" layout). Falling back to the preceding lines is what
makes a compliant reviewer's rejection actionable. Keep the prompt's ordering guidance and this
precedence in sync — see buildMergeReviewSystemPrompt.
