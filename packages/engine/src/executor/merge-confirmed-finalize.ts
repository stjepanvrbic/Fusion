 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowMerge 2026-06-29-08:32:
 * A workflow graph merge node can await a successful ProjectEngine merge request and return before the row reaches `done`. Merge confirmation is durable proof of landing; the executor must finalize that row from any non-terminal column instead of re-running parse or clearing mergeDetails.
 *
 * FNXC:WorkflowMerge 2026-06-29-23:12:
 * FN-7261 exposed stale no-op proof as a re-execution blocker: a reopened task with incomplete implementation steps and only no-op merge proof must fall through to merge-state cleanup/reverification, not consume execute() by repeatedly trying blocked finalization.

    Ask the CONDITION, not the sentence.

    This carve-out exists because a no-op merge confirmation with no landed commit is not proof that
    the work was done: when the steps are still unfinished the run must fall through to stale-merge
    cleanup and reverification instead of being consumed here. It selected that case by comparing the
    blocker reason with `===` against the exact string "task has incomplete steps".

    The merge-authority work then made refusals more informative, so a card in an error state now
    reports `task is marked 'failed': … task has incomplete steps`. Same meaning, different sentence —
    and this stopped matching, silently, so the fall-through never happened again. A blocker message is
    written for an operator and will be reworded again; `hasNonTerminalSteps` is the rule underneath it
    and cannot drift from `getTaskMergeBlocker`, which is defined from the same set.
