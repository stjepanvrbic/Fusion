/**
 * Task ↔ CLI session orchestration (CLI Agent Executor, U7).
 *
 * This module is the bridge between the task execute pipeline and the engine-
 * owned CLI session machinery (U2 CliSessionManager + U3 TelemetryHub /
 * state machine + U17 hook scripts). It takes a task + the resolved workflow-
 * node executor config and runs one CLI agent through the execute step:
 *
 *   1. Spawn a CLI session in the task worktree (CliSessionManager.spawn). A
 *      CliConcurrencyLimitError at the ceiling is propagated as a typed error
 *      (the seam surfaces it as a queued/rejected task state — never a stall).
 *   2. Mint the per-session hook token (TelemetryHub.issueToken) and write the
 *      session-scoped hook scripts (writeSessionHookScripts) into a scratch dir.
 *   3. Build the adapter launch settings (the Claude adapter consumes the written
 *      hook-script paths via its settings flow). NOTE: the launch invocation is
 *      computed by the manager from the settings we pass through `spawn`; this
 *      module assembles those settings BEFORE spawn so the hooks are wired at
 *      launch.
 *   4. Inject the task prompt after readiness (manager.waitForReady → inject).
 *   5. Subscribe to the state machine and resolve on a terminal signal (R20):
 *        - native `done`           → success      (PTY reaped at handoff)
 *        - generic-tier `idle`     → NEVER resolves; `confirmAdvance()` resolves
 *                                    it as success (the operator affordance)
 *        - `needsAttention`        → needs-attention (stall / userExited /
 *                                    authFailed escalation)
 *        - `killed`                → killed       (hard cancel / column exit)
 *
 * Config snapshot: the resolved executor config is captured at launch. A mid-run
 * node-config edit therefore applies to the NEXT run only — this object holds the
 * launch-time snapshot.
 *
 * Re-entry policy (caller-driven):
 *   - A needs-replan / RETHINK re-entry launches a FRESH session: the caller
 *     kills any prior live session for the task first (see
 *     `killLiveTaskSessions`) and calls `launchCliTaskSession` again.
 *   - A follow-up to a done task resumes the recorded native session id when the
 *     adapter supports it (`followUp`); if resume is unsupported or fails the
 *     follow-up falls back to a fresh launch.
 *
 * Pure engine code: no dashboard imports, no HTTP. The hub is the in-process
 * telemetry sink; the dashboard route (U17) forwards validated hook POSTs into it.

/**
 * Terminal outcome of a CLI task session, mapped from the authoritative state

 *
 * - `success`        — a positive completion signal arrived (native done, or the
 *                      generic-tier confirm-advance affordance). The pipeline
 *                      advances; the PTY is reaped at the execute→in-review handoff.
 * - `needs-attention`— stall backstop, clean userExit mid-task, or auth failure.
 *                      The task does NOT advance and is NOT a hard failure — it
 *                      needs a human.
 * - `killed`         — hard cancel / column exit SIGKILL'd the PTY. Never resume-
 *                      eligible; the task left in-progress.
 * - `user-exited`    — the child exited cleanly mid-task (no done). Surfaced as
 *                      needs-attention by the caller, but recorded precisely.
 * - `auth-failed`    — credential failure; needs re-authentication.

  Every PTY exit produces exactly one terminal outcome for its task session, so the graph node awaiting result() always returns.
  Nothing used to forward the exit to the state machine: an exit before readiness hung the node forever, and an exit mid-turn waited for the 5-minute stall and never classified crashed, authFailed or userExited.
  A natural exit is classified by the machine and escalated to needs-attention (no in-run resume driver owns a crash); an engine kill resolves as killed.
