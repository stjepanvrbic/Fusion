/**
 * Rate Limit Retry — wraps async agent work with exponential backoff
 * specifically for rate-limit / usage-limit errors.
 *
 * FNXC:ProviderRateLimitIsolation 2026-07-21-18:00:
 * When an AI model returns a rate limit error (429, overloaded, quota, etc.),
 * this utility retries the operation with exponential backoff before letting
 * the error propagate to the caller's catch block, which triggers a global
 * provider-scoped task park via `UsageLimitPauser`.
 *
 * **Backoff strategy:** `delay = min(baseDelayMs × 2^attempt, maxDelayMs)` with
 * ±10 % jitter to avoid thundering-herd effects across concurrent agents.
 *
 * **Abort support:** An optional `AbortSignal` allows the engine to cancel
 * pending retries when a task is paused, cancelled, or the engine is shutting
 * down — so agents don't sit in a 2-minute sleep unnecessarily.
 *
 * **Scope:** Rate-limit errors (as classified by `isUsageLimitError`) are
 * retried with the backoff curve above. Transient authentication errors (as
 * classified by `isTransientAuthError` — e.g. an OAuth access token rotating
 * mid-run) get their own small retry budget with a short flat delay. All other
 * error types are re-thrown immediately so existing error handling
 * (transient-error retry, failure marking, etc.) is unaffected.

FNXC:EngineAuthRetry 2026-07-05-06:07:
A long-running agent session holds its OAuth access token in memory. Claude Max access tokens rotate mid-run (~8 h lifetime); the in-flight call fails with a 401 authentication_error even though the credentials file has already been refreshed, and the very next call succeeds. Retry these a few times so a token-boundary rotation does not surface as a spurious task-failure alert. This budget is separate from the rate-limit retry budget and must not consume rate-limit attempts.

FNXC:EngineAuthRetry 2026-07-12-20:10:
The transient-auth classifier moved to transient-error-detector.ts (isTransientAuthCredentialError) so the same rotation-vs-operator-actionable decision drives this in-run retry AND durable-agent heartbeat error recovery / self-healing (FN-7835/FN-7844/FN-7859). Scope-grant failures and invalid/missing API keys are excluded there — the operator must act, so they surface immediately instead of retrying.

FNXC:ClaudeCliRateLimit 2026-10-10-17:52:
Operators run Claude Code with an account switcher (cswap) that moves the local `claude` login to another subscription account when one nears its usage limit.
Its auto mode polls usage on an interval (15 s in the operator's setup), so a 429 from the `pi-claude-cli` provider is often cleared within a minute.
Every retry starts a new session turn, and the provider spawns a fresh `claude` process per turn, which reads the switched credentials.
The ladder waits 20 s (one poll interval plus margin), then 45 s (about 65 s since the first failure), then 90 s (about 2.5 min in total) before the caller's existing rate-limit handling, such as the external-block freeze, takes over.
It has its own budget, independent of `maxRetries`, because its purpose is waiting for account rotation rather than for the provider's own limit window.
