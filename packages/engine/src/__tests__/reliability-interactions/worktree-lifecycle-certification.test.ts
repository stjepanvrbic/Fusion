FNXC:WorktreeLifecycleCertification 2026-08-17-20:59:
Certification suite for the invariant "a task's worktree is held across the full lifecycle".
Motivating incident: a user's worktree was lost between in-review and in-progress. Root cause
anatomy is a two-step: (1) a self-healing sweep nulls `task.worktree` while the card idles in
review — the in-review branch rebind did this unconditionally as part of a *branch* repair —
then (2) `scanIdleWorktrees` no longer counts the directory as active, so the idle sweep / cap
enforcement `git worktree remove`s it, making the loss permanent.

This suite pins:
- worktree + branch metadata and the on-disk directory survive every in-progress ↔ in-review
  transition, including idle-in-review maintenance ticks (branch rebind + metadata reconcile);
- the branch-rebind sweep preserves a live checkout that is checked out on the rebound branch
  (and still clears a dangling pointer whose directory is gone — the legacy behavior);
- a worktree referenced by an unfinished task is never classified idle/reapable, and nulling
  the metadata is precisely what makes it reapable (the two-step mechanism itself).

Real git + real PG; reliability lane (serialized) — deliberately NOT gate-eligible.
