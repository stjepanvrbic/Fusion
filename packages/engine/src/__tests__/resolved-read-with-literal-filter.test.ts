FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-21:40 (the MISSED PAIR ratchet, generalised past self-healing):

THE DEFECT THIS CATCHES, found in `executor.ts` after the sibling ratchet found five in
`self-healing.ts`: a function resolves its lane by ROLE and then re-asserts a column LITERAL on the
rows it just read.

    const tasks = await this.listWipLaneTasks();            // resolved by role
    const inProgress = tasks.filter((t) => t.column === "in-progress" && …);   // literal

On a renamed board the read finds the work and the filter discards all of it. This is worse than an
unconverted read, and much harder to notice:

  - the read LOOKS converted, so a reviewer scanning for `listTasks({ column: "…" })` sees nothing;
  - the census scores only the comparison, so the backlog number moves the wrong way;
  - a STRUCTURAL test that pins "the read asks for resolved lanes" passes — `resumeOrphaned` had one,
    and it was green for the entire time the sweep was dead.

`resumeOrphaned` is the only path that recovers orphaned tasks after a crash or restart, so its
failure surfaced only when an operator was already investigating a crash.

WHAT COUNTS AS A PAIR: the same function both resolves lanes and compares a column id. The fallback
arm of a resolved ternary is NOT a pair — `lanes ? lanes.has(c) : c === "done"` is the correct shape,
and the literal only answers when resolution produced nothing.
