/*
FNXC:UnownedHoldColumnGates 2026-07-29-13:20 (U7 / R3, R12 — workflow-owned lifecycle):

Two lifecycle-column literals nobody's unit claimed, both asking "is this card in
the hold column?" by the id `"todo"`.

Picked up because the drift review's convergence count is what gates U11: the
merged Planning column KEEPS the id `todo` and DELETES `triage`, so a `=== "todo"`
comparison is not itself the breakage — but a workflow that renamed its hold column
is broken TODAY by both of these, and neither file appears in any unit's file list.

  gridlock-detector.ts  — `column !== "todo"` decides which cards count as
    SCHEDULABLE. On a renamed workflow nothing is ever schedulable, so the detector
    concludes there is no gridlock to report at exactly the moment a real one would
    be visible: it returns early on an empty schedulable set. A detector that goes
    quiet on the boards it cannot parse is worse than one that is absent, because
    its silence reads as health.

  mission-autopilot.ts  — `column !== "todo"` decides whether a retried mission task
    still needs moving. On a renamed workflow the answer is always "yes, move it",
    and the move TARGET is the literal `"todo"` too — so autopilot relocates the
    card into a column the workflow may not declare (R7) on every retry.

Both resolve the hold role from the task's own workflow. Both are async with store
access, so they resolve directly rather than needing the injected-lane pattern the
synchronous predicates required (#2551).
