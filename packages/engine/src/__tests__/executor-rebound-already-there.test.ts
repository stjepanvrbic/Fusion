/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-15:30 (Phase C convergence — executor rebound guards):

THE INVARIANT: an engine rebound moves the card only when it is NOT already in the column the
rebound resolves to — on ANY workflow, not just the default lineage.

WHAT WAS BROKEN. `resolveReboundColumnFor` was converted in U5b, so every rebound MOVE targeted
the workflow's own backlog column. The eight `X.column !== "todo"` guards standing in front of
those moves were not converted. On a renamed board the guard was therefore always true, and the
engine issued a move into the column the card was already sitting in.

WHY THAT IS NOT HARMLESS. `moveTaskInternal` runs the reset-on-entry effects on every real move.
So the redundant move re-cleared status/error/pause state, and at the stale-parse-pins site
(`preserveProgress: false`) it RESET STEP PROGRESS a second time on a card that had merely been
re-checked. The half-conversion shape again: the right target, reached through a check that could
not see it.

This drives `parkCompletedBlockedTask` — the FN-7926 completed-but-blocked park — because it is
the rebound site reachable without standing up a graph run. The other seven sites take the
identical shape and are covered by the same predicate; that is stated rather than implied.

  fails. Two tests with identical fixtures are one test with two names.
