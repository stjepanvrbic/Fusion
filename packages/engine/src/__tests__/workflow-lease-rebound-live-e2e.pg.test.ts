FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-29-09:20 (E2E — closing the mesh-lease ledger entry):

`mesh-lease-manager.ts` — where a RECOVERED LEASE rebounds to. Its conversion note
records a defect worth reproducing precisely:

    "They were previously two independent `=== "todo"` comparisons that could
     disagree, which is how the audit came to claim a card landed in `todo` when
     the workflow has no such column."

So there are two distinct things to prove, and only one of them is where the card
ends up:

  1. the card actually rebounds to the RENAMED workflow's own rebound column;
  2. the AUDIT reports the column the card actually reached.

(2) is the one that rotted silently. An audit trail that names a column the board
does not have is worse than no audit: it is the thing an operator reads to work out
where a recovered card went, and it was confidently wrong.

DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED AS RENAMED: `decisionPath` keeps its legacy
`lease-recovered-to-todo` wording. The code says why — it is a stable discriminator
existing queries and dashboards match on, and renaming it would break them to
describe the same decision. The column actually used travels in `newColumn`. This
suite pins that split so a future "cleanup" cannot quietly rename the discriminator.

No git anywhere in this path; MeshLeaseManager takes a TaskStore.

FNXC:LifecycleContainment 2026-10-08-05:45:
KB-045 keeps lease recovery in the card's current lifecycle role. A WIP card now stays in WIP with its lease released, and the audit reports `lease-recovered-in-place` with the persisted column. An intake card still rebounds forward to the workflow's own hold column, which is where the legacy `lease-recovered-to-todo` discriminator remains pinned.
