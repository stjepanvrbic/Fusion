/**
 * U8 — self-healing + stuck-detector CLI-session awareness.
 *
 * Idle-worktree sweeps (enforceWorktreeCap, cleanupOrphans, reapUnregisteredOrphans)
 * must SKIP a worktree backing a resume-eligible cli_sessions record; the stuck
 * detector must suppress stuck/inactivity flagging while a task's CLI session is
 * waitingOnInput, yet still flag a genuinely-quiet session.
 *
 * The sweeps + module functions are exercised through the narrow seams
 * (isWorktreeResumeReserved option / isCliSessionWaitingOnInput option) with the
 * heavy git/FS dependencies mocked.
