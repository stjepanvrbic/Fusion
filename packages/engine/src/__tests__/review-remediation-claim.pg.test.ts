FNXC:ReviewRemediation 2026-08-31-08:20:
The remediation claim has three tiers and only the FIRST -- a PostgreSQL advisory-lock CAS through
`updateWorkflowStepResultsFenced` -- is the correctness boundary; the rest exist for unit
compatibility. Every mock-store test in this repo therefore exercises tier 2 and CANNOT observe what
production does.

That gap is not theoretical. FN-270 and FN-273 held a real REVISE with critical findings and produced
no fix steps, while a faithful mock replay of the same rows (real workflow IR, real verdict, real
findings) appended remediation and handed the card back. Everything modellable works; the divergence
lives in the tier no mock reaches, and the claim's non-`unavailable` refusals return SILENTLY:

    if (outcome.applied) return { applied: true, task: outcome.task };
    if (outcome.reason !== "unavailable") return { applied: false };

This pins what the real fenced tier answers for the exact production row shape, so the question stops
being answered by deduction. Auto-skips without PostgreSQL, so it never gates a merge.
