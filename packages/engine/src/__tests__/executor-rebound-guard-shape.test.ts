FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-18:55 (PR #2635 review, greptile P2):

"Seven rebound sites remain untested" — fair, and stating it as a coverage note was not an answer.
Seven of the eight sit inside graph-failure / stuck-kill / dependency-gate paths that need a live
graph run to reach, so behavioural coverage for each would cost more scaffolding than the change
itself. What they share is a SHAPE, so the shape is what gets pinned.

This is a static check over `executor.ts`: every guard in front of a rebound move must compare
against a RESOLVED value, never a column literal. It fails on the exact defect the PR fixes — a
`column !== "todo"` check standing in front of a `moveTask(..., reboundColumn)` — at whichever of
the eight sites it is reintroduced, including sites added later that no behavioural test knows about.

It is a static check and is labelled as one: it proves the pattern is absent, not that each path
behaves. `executor-rebound-already-there.test.ts` carries the behavioural proof for the one
reachable site (`parkCompletedBlockedTask`).

It lives in its OWN file because the shared executor test helpers mock `node:fs`, so a suite that
imports them cannot read source off disk — a detail worth writing down, since the failure looks
like a broken path rather than a mocked module.

The rebound moves this guard covers no longer live in `executor.ts`. The package code-organization
waves (1cf86baa1c "executor pure peels", and the later per-concern peels) moved every one of them
into `src/executor/*.ts`, which left this static check scanning a file with zero matches — a guard
reporting success on an empty set. The scan now covers the whole executor family (`executor.ts` plus
every module under `executor/`), so the invariant follows the code instead of the filename.
