// In-flight request deduplication with redirect-on-forceFresh.
//
// Basic case: when N components mount and each calls the same fetcher, the
// "check cache → fetch → store on completion" pattern fires N concurrent
// requests because every caller sees an empty cache. Routing those callers
// through this helper collapses the burst into a single network request.
//
// forceFresh case: a caller that has just committed a mutation passes
// `forceFresh: true` so it doesn't join a pre-mutation in-flight request and
// return stale data. The OLD callers that already joined the in-flight
// request are ALSO redirected — they receive the fresh response from the new
// fetch, not the stale one. This is implemented by decoupling the external
// promise that callers await from the inner fetch promise: a forceFresh
// invocation discards the old inner fetch's eventual resolution and assigns
// the new inner fetch's resolution to the SAME external promise that old
// callers are waiting on. No caller ever observes pre-mutation data once a
// post-mutation forceFresh has been requested.
//
// Layered caching (e.g. usePluginUiSlots' 60s TTL) is unaffected — that runs
// at the hook layer, above this helper.
