# runfusion.ai

Launch [Fusion](https://runfusion.ai) with a single npx:

```bash
npx runfusion.ai
```

That command boots the Fusion dashboard and AI engine on port 4040. Prints an `Open:` URL with a bearer token you can click to open in your browser.

## Subcommands

With no arguments, `runfusion.ai` defaults to `dashboard`. Any other subcommand is forwarded to the underlying [`fn` CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@runfusion/fusion):

```bash
npx runfusion.ai                     # → fn dashboard
npx runfusion.ai task create "fix X" # → fn task create "fix X"
npx runfusion.ai --help              # → fn --help
```

## How it relates to `@runfusion/fusion`

This package is a ~1 KB alias. It declares `@runfusion/fusion` as a dependency and forwards to the same `fn` CLI. The `runfusion.ai` and `runfusion` commands have their own tiny entry that defaults to `dashboard` when run with no arguments (on Windows, macOS and Linux alike), while the `fn` and `fusion` commands it also installs forward arguments verbatim. Use whichever name reads better:

```bash
npx runfusion.ai
npx @runfusion/fusion dashboard
```

For persistent installs, prefer Homebrew or `npm install -g @runfusion/fusion`.
