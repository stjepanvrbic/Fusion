FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-07:55 (batch-core):

THE MERGE QUEUE MUST FILL AND DRAIN ON A BOARD THAT RENAMED ITS REVIEW LANE.

`enqueueMergeQueueInTransaction` admitted a card only from the literal `in-review`, and
`dequeueMergeQueueOnColumnExitInTransaction` removed it only when leaving that same literal. Both run
inside the move transaction with a `tx` handle and no store, so neither could resolve the lane itself
— the resolved set now comes from `moves.ts`, which already resolves the workflow for the move.

WHY THE PAIR IS TESTED TOGETHER AND NOT SEPARATELY. Converting one half alone is undetectable: if
enqueue keeps the literal, nothing is ever queued on a renamed board, so a dequeue test has nothing to
observe and passes vacuously. If dequeue keeps the literal, the queue fills and never drains — a leak
that only shows up on the SECOND move. One test drives the whole cycle so neither half can regress
without failing.

WHY A LIVE STORE. The bug is which column id the guard compares against, and that id comes from the
task's own persisted workflow. A mock handing back a lifecycle struct would assert my own assumption
about what `resolveReviewColumns` returns — the substitution that has produced vacuous tests all
through this program. This drives real PostgreSQL and asserts on OBSERVED QUEUE ROWS.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped by `pgDescribe` when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so the merge gate is
unaffected. Throwaway per-file database; never port 4040.
