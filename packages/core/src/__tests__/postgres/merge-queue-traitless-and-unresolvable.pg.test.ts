FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-15:30 (#2819 review — greptile, two findings):

THE TWO WAYS THIS CONVERSION COULD RE-CREATE THE BUG IT FIXES.

Both are the same mistake in different clothes — treating "I have no answer" as "the answer is no
review lane" — and both land on boards that are not even custom.

  1. TRAITLESS (v1-UPGRADED) BOARDS. `synthesizeDefaultColumns` (workflow-ir.ts:158) upgrades a v1
     graph by emitting the default column ids with `traits: []`. `resolveReviewColumns` therefore
     returns EMPTY while the board's `in-review` column plainly exists and holds the card. Forwarding
     that empty set to the enqueue guard makes it match nothing and throw
     `MergeQueueInvalidColumnError` — moving the failure off custom boards and onto EVERY pre-v2
     project. Three states, not two: unreadable and traitless both take the legacy id; only a board
     that expresses traits and still declares no review lane is answering.

  2. FAILED RESOLUTION DURING THE STALE SWEEP. The sweep's SQL predicate is a candidate superset and
     each row is verified per task before deletion. The first pass deleted a row whose resolution
     FAILED, which is the original bug behind a narrower trigger: a transient workflow-read failure
     silently drops a valid card out of the merge queue, with an audit event claiming
     `reason: "not-in-review"` for a task sitting in review. Sparing is recoverable (the lease
     predicates refuse it anyway, and the next sweep removes it once resolution succeeds); deleting
     is not.

WHY A LIVE STORE. Both defects live in the seam between a resolver and SQL evaluated by PostgreSQL.
A mock supplying a lifecycle struct would assert my own assumption about what the resolver returns,
which is the substitution that has produced vacuous tests throughout this program.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped by `pgDescribe` when PostgreSQL is unreachable; throwaway per-file
database; never port 4040.
