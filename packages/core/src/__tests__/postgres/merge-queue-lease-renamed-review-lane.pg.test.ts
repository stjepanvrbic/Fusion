FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-14:35 (#2819 review — greptile, "renamed entries remain unleaseable"):

A QUEUED CARD ON A RENAMED BOARD MUST ACTUALLY BE LEASEABLE.

The first pass on this PR taught only the STALE SWEEP to resolve review lanes, so the row survived
cleanup — and then both eligibility predicates in `acquireMergeQueueLease` still demanded the literal
`in-review`, matched nothing, and the row sat in the queue forever. That is a worse failure than the
one it replaced: a deleted row at least emits `mergeQueue:auto-cleanup-stale-row`, while an
unleaseable row is a silent permanent stall with a healthy-looking queue.

WHY THE SWEEP FIX ALONE LOOKED GREEN. Its test asserted the row still EXISTS after acquisition. Row
survival and row leaseability are different questions, and the sweep fix answered only the first —
the acquire returning `null` was consistent with an empty queue and nothing distinguished them. So
these cases assert the LEASE, which is the outcome the merger actually depends on.

BOTH ACQUIRE MODES ARE COVERED. Targeted acquire (`targetTaskId`) and queue-head acquire are separate
code paths with separate predicates; the merger uses targeted, self-healing recovery uses the head.
Converting one and leaving the other is the half-converted-pair shape this program keeps hitting.

WHY A LIVE STORE. The predicate is SQL evaluated by PostgreSQL against a column id that comes from
the task's own persisted workflow. A mock cannot exercise it at all.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped by `pgDescribe` when PostgreSQL is unreachable; throwaway per-file
database; never port 4040.
