FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-08:20 (Phase C convergence — default-workflow-hooks.ts):

THE INVARIANT: a reopen is "live work (wip/review/complete) back into a planning lane
(intake/hold)", decided from the moving task's OWN workflow — not from the default
lineage's column names.

WHY THIS IS A SAFETY TEST AND NOT A TIDYING TEST. `default-workflow-hooks.ts` is named
for the default workflow but the store runs it on the flag-ON path for EVERY workflow
(the trait registry resolves each hook by trait id, not by workflow). Its reopen
predicates were lists of the default lineage's names, so on a renamed board every reopen
effect silently did nothing. One of those effects clears `workflowStepResults`, and
`getTaskMergeBlocker` reads exactly that: a card bounced out of review kept its OLD
review results, and a `passed` result satisfies the merge gate. So a renamed workflow
could merge with its re-review never run — the same regression the graph-owned-crossing
carve-out in `applyReopenFieldClears` exists to prevent, arriving through the other door.

The `todo`/`triage` names are the thing being removed here, which is why this file is
part of the triage-guard convergence and not a separate refactor: `default-workflow-hooks.ts`
held 4 of them and `moves.ts`'s flag-ON mirror held 1 more.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CONVERTED: the flag-OFF inline block in `moves.ts` (~line 867).
That branch IS the legacy path and is kept verbatim on purpose so the two paths can be
parity-checked; converting it would erase the reference implementation.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-04:40 (fleet phase — the same safety argument, applied to TIMING):
The header of this file explains why the reopen predicates had to stop naming the default lineage: these
hooks run on the flag-ON path for EVERY workflow, because the trait registry resolves each hook by trait
id, not by workflow. The timing, completion and in-review hooks had the same defect and were not part of
that conversion.

What it costs on a renamed board, none of it throwing:
  - `applyTimingEffects` accrues `cumulativeActiveMs` while a card sits in the WIP lane. With the lane
    named, the exit test never fires, so NO active time is accrued and every duration display —
    `productivity-analytics.ts`, `task-timing.ts` — reads zero.
  - `applyCompletionTimingEffects` never stamps `executionCompletedAt`, so a finished card looks
    unfinished to anything reading that field.
  - `applyInReviewEnterEffects` returns early, so the recovery counters it clears stay set.

THE HOOKS ARE CALLED DIRECTLY here, not through `applyDefaultWorkflowMoveEffects`. I wrote it through the
dispatcher first and all three cases failed on the DEFAULT lineage too: the dispatcher resolves hooks by
TRAIT, and neither test IR declares the `timing` trait, so those hooks never ran at all. Going through the
dispatcher would have tested the trait registry's wiring, not this conversion — and would have looked like
a conversion bug.

REVERT CHECK, measured (all three run): restoring the `in-progress` literals leaves `cumulativeActiveMs`
undefined on the renamed board; restoring the `done` literal leaves `executionCompletedAt` unset;
restoring the `in-review` literal leaves `recoveryRetryCount` at 3. Every case runs on BOTH lineages, and
the default one passes either way — which is the point of running it.

    The producer built this set from `mergeOrchestration` alone, so a workflow hosting review on a
    `humanReview`- or `mergeBlocker`-only lane skipped `applyInReviewEnterEffects` entirely — the
    recovery counters it clears stayed set for a card plainly in review.

    Fixed by using core's `resolveReviewColumns` (#2730) rather than a fifth inline union. That is the
    BROAD set, which is right here: these hooks ASK the question and move nothing on the answer. A
    caller that admits and then MOVES wants the narrow single lane — #2750 documents the split.

    `lifecycleColumnSets` is populated only when the caller resolved an IR, so an empty array means the
    board was READ and declares no WIP lane. The first version guarded on `length > 0` and fell back to
    the singular id and then the legacy name, so a traitless column merely NAMED `in-progress` accrued
    timing as though it were the WIP lane.

    Undefined means "could not read"; empty means "read, and the answer is none". Same distinction as
    #2731's `?? {}` and #2733's refusal to invent a complete column — which I applied in both of those
