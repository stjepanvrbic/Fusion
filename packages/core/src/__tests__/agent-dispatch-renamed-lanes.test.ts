FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-14:50 (fleet phase — the dispatcher's own filters):
`selectNextTaskForAgentImpl` picks an agent's next task by filtering the board for its WIP lane, then its
hold lane. Both were `task.column === "<literal>"`.

THE FAILURE: on a board whose lanes are renamed, both filters match nothing, so an agent asking for work
is told there is none — with its own assigned tasks sitting right there in the list it just fetched. No
error, no log line. The agent simply idles.

`agent-heartbeat-worktree-renamed-hold.test.ts` covers acquisition-failure containment on a renamed board; nothing
covered the dispatcher's SELECTION filters, which is why this file exists rather than a case added there.

WHY THE IMPL DIRECTLY. The existing `selectNextTaskForAgent` coverage in
`agent-store-routing-policy.test.ts` drives a real store harness, so exercising a renamed vocabulary there
means registering a real custom workflow and moving cards through it. This test is about which lane the
filters name, so it calls the impl with a store fake that resolves a renamed IR — the same shape used for
the reconciler in #2737. The bind evaluator is exercised for real; only the store is faked — and that claim is now TRUE, which it
was not when first written. `selectNextTaskForAgentImpl`'s `agent` argument is OPTIONAL and I omitted it, so
`isBindCompatible` hit its `if (!agent) return true` short-circuit and `evaluateImplementationTaskBind` never
ran. The header asserted coverage the invocation did not produce — the same "comment claims what the code
does not do" defect this program keeps finding, in my own test. Every case now passes an executor agent.

REVERT CHECK, measured (both run): restoring `task.column === "in-progress"` fails the WIP case with
`expected null to be truthy`; restoring `task.column === "todo"` fails the hold case the same way. The
default-vocabulary cases pass either way, which is why both vocabularies run.

    `evaluateImplementationTaskBind` short-circuits to `allowed: true` when that is false. On a renamed
    board EVERY agent is therefore bind-compatible with EVERY task, and the role check that stops a liaison
    being handed implementation work does not apply at all.
