/**
 * Async Drizzle archive / lineage helpers (U14).
 *
 * FNXC:TaskStoreArchiveLineage 2026-06-24-07:00:
 * Async equivalents of the sync SQLite archive and lineage call sites in
 * store.ts and archive-db.ts. These helpers target the PostgreSQL
 * `project.archived_tasks`, `archive.archived_tasks`, `project.tasks`, and the
 * document/artifact tables via Drizzle, and preserve the load-bearing archive
 * and lineage invariants:
 *
 *   VAL-CROSS-014 — Soft-deleting a child task allows its parent to be deleted
 *     (the soft-deleted child no longer blocks). The lineage-integrity gate
 *     (from async-lifecycle) excludes soft-deleted children, so a parent whose
 *     only children are soft-deleted can be deleted immediately.
 *   VAL-CROSS-015 — Archiving a parent task scopes its documents/artifacts out
 *     of live views but preserves them for restore. When a task is archived,
 *     its `task_documents` and `artifacts` rows are retained (the FK is
 *     ON DELETE CASCADE, not ON DELETE SET NULL, so an archive — which is a
 *     soft column move, not a row delete — keeps them). Live document/artifact
 *     views filter by the parent task's live state (`deleted_at IS NULL` and
 *     `column != 'archived'`), so the rows disappear from live views but
 *     remain for an unarchive restore.
 *
 * Transition context (see library/taskstore-persistence-notes.md):
 *   `getDatabase()` still returns the sync `Database` until U15 flips it. The
 *   TaskStore facade keeps its sync archive path (the gate depends on it).
 *   These helpers are the async target the migrating store and the PostgreSQL
 *   integration tests consume. They program against the stable `AsyncDataLayer`
 *   interface (U4), not the underlying driver.

 * Behavioral contract (VAL-CROSS-014 + VAL-CROSS-015):

 *      not pass `removeLineageReferences: true`, the archive is rejected

 *      child ids). Soft-deleted children are excluded by the gate, so a parent
 *      whose only child was soft-deleted archives immediately (VAL-CROSS-014).
 *   2. **Lineage clear** — when `removeLineageReferences: true`, the live
 *      children's `source_parent_task_id` is cleared so they no longer block.
 *   3. **Archive snapshot** — a cold-storage snapshot is written to
 *      `archive.archived_tasks` for restore (VAL-CROSS-015).
 *   4. **Soft-delete** — the project row is soft-deleted (`deleted_at` set,
 *      `column = 'archived'`). The documents and artifacts rows are retained
 *      (the FK is ON DELETE CASCADE, and a soft-delete is an UPDATE not a
