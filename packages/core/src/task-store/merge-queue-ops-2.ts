Merge-queue enqueue is PostgreSQL-only via `enqueueMergeQueueAsync` (task-artifacts-ops.ts); the sync

was carried in the census as deferred debt "needing a store-architecture change to convert". It needed

    FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-08-02-10:20 (fleet: the PR-merged transition):
    The conditional move supplies ONE LOCKED LIVE ROW for evidence checks and the move target. Earlier
    versions read twice around separate writes, allowing two observers to independently decide that they
    had completed the same task before either move became visible.

    On a renamed board every one of those answered wrong in the same direction: `column === "done"` never
    matched, so an already-complete card was not skipped as `already-done`; `column !== "in-review"` always
    matched, so the transition bailed with `wrong-column` for a card sitting in review. The net effect is
    that a PR merged on GitHub never advanced the card — the visible symptom is a merged PR whose Fusion
    task stays in review forever, which reads as a webhook problem rather than a column problem.

    The move target comes from the same snapshot: converting the guards alone would admit the card and then
    move it to a column the board does not declare, which is the half-conversion this program keeps paying
    for. A board with no complete column refuses the transition instead of inventing one.

    A WORKFLOW THAT DECLARES COLUMNS BUT NO COMPLETE LANE REFUSES, it does not fall back to `done`. My first
    version wrote `?? "done"` while the comment above it claimed the transition refuses rather than inventing
    a column — the reviewer read the code, not the prose, and was right. `moveTask` would have rejected the
    undeclared `done` and left the merged card in review, which is the exact failure this conversion exists to
    prevent, reintroduced by a two-character default.

    The distinction is `PlannerLanes`' contract, and it is the one the whole program keeps re-learning:
      - NO LANE INFORMATION AT ALL (v1 IR, unresolvable store) -> the legacy ids ARE the answer; nothing has
        told us otherwise and today's behaviour is correct.
      - LANES RESOLVED, complete ABSENT -> the board genuinely has no completion column. Substituting one
        invents a destination; refusing is the honest outcome and is visible in the return value.
