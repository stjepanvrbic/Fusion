FN-9349's ownership proof originally required the marker file to EXACTLY equal the
`${pid}\nrunToken=...` string globalSetup wrote. In real forked-worker runs that check never
passes: each worker fork re-writes the marker with its OWN pid via vitest-setup's ensureWorkerRoot(),
so by teardown the marker carries a worker pid, never the main pid globalSetup captured. Teardown
then skipped removal and leaked one fusion-test-workers-* root per vitest invocation (106 stale roots
accumulated, tripping check-test-isolation). The single-process unit tests masked it because pid is
constant there. The durable ownership signal is the RUN TOKEN, which is shared across a run's main
process and all its worker forks (env-inherited) and differs only for a genuine successor invocation.
Prove ownership by run token, not by the pid-bearing full string.
