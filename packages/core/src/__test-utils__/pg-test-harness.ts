/**
 * FNXC:TestMigrationTail 2026-06-24-16:00:
 * Reusable PostgreSQL test fixture for the SQLite→PostgreSQL migration.
 *
 * `createTaskStoreForTest()` is the canonical helper that test files use to
 * obtain a PG-backed TaskStore (or any store) connected to a fresh, isolated
 * PostgreSQL database. It eliminates the ~60 lines of boilerplate (adminExec,
 * CREATE/DROP DATABASE, connection set, schema baseline, AsyncDataLayer) that
 * every postgres/*.test.ts file previously duplicated.
 *
 * Design:
 *   - Each call creates a uniquely-named test database (DB-per-test isolation).
 *   - The schema baseline is applied via the schema applier.
 *   - The returned `PgTestHarness` exposes the ready `TaskStore`, the raw
 *     `AsyncDataLayer` (for direct row seeding), and a `teardown()` that drops
 *     the database and closes all connections.
 *   - When PostgreSQL is unreachable (or FUSION_PG_TEST_SKIP=1), the describe
 *     blocks that use `pgDescribe` are skipped in optional lanes. A lane that
 *     sets FUSION_PG_TEST_REQUIRED=1 (the `test:pg-gate` merge-gate lane)
 *     fails instead, so the gate can never pass with its PG suites skipped.
 *
 * Usage pattern:
 * ```ts
 * import { pgDescribe, createTaskStoreForTest } from "@fusion/test-utils/pg-test-harness";
 *
 * const pgTest = pgDescribe("my PG integration test");
 *
 * pgTest("creates a task and reads it back", async () => {
 *   const h = await createTaskStoreForTest();
 *   try {
 *     const task = await h.store.createTask({ description: "hello" });
 *     expect(task.id).toBeTruthy();
 *   } finally {
 *     await h.teardown();
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The optional-lane contract: tests using this helper are auto-skipped when PG
 * is not available. The required `test:pg-gate` lane is the exception and fails
 * loudly. Run locally with PG on 5432 (or FUSION_PG_TEST_URL_BASE) to exercise
 * the PG paths.

FNXC:PgTestTemplateDb 2026-07-19-17:20:
Slow-test fix (gate reliability): the per-module nonce template applied the full
Fusion schema baseline (~530ms of DDL) once PER isolated test file. With ~24
pg-gate files fanned across forks against one PostgreSQL server, those baselines
run concurrently, the DDL/CREATE DATABASE calls serialize server-side, and the
per-file `beforeAll` blew past the 15s hookTimeout nondeterministically (observed
18/23 then 5/23 then 8/23 files failing across back-to-back runs). Raising the
timeout is forbidden appeasement, so instead we remove the redundant work: apply
the baseline exactly ONCE per vitest invocation into a run-shared, read-only
"golden" template, then build each per-module template as a fast server-side
`CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE golden` copy. Concurrent copies from one
connection-free template are safe (empirically verified); only active sessions on
a template trigger "source database is being accessed". Per-module templates and
their drop/half-built/exists lifecycle hooks are preserved so module isolation
and the template-concurrency regression tests keep their exact semantics.

The golden template is named with the vitest MAIN-process pid
(FUSION_PG_TEMPLATE_OWNER_PID, exported by globalSetup and inherited by every
fork) plus the shared run token, so all forks of one run resolve the SAME golden
name and the existing dead-pid sweep reclaims it once the run's main process
exits. Cross-fork build coordination uses a Postgres advisory lock keyed on the
golden name; readiness is tracked by a marker table in the maintenance database
so the readiness check never opens a session on the golden template.

FNXC:PgTestOrphanSweep 2026-09-28-00:32:
Slow-test fix (gate reliability): a vitest invocation that is killed or crashes
before its `afterEach`/`afterAll`/`drop()` runs leaves its per-file databases
(`uniqueDbName` -> `<prefix>_<pid>_<counter>_<random6>`) behind. Unlike the
template databases, these per-file databases had NO reclamation path, so across
many interrupted local runs they accumulated unbounded (measured 1533 leftover
`fusion_*` databases on one dev box). PostgreSQL CREATE/DROP DATABASE cost grows
with the catalog size, so at that volume every per-file `beforeAll` CREATE
DATABASE crossed 7s and the whole pg-gate reported 15s hookTimeouts.

`parsePerFileDbPid` recognizes the per-file naming tail (`_<pid>_<counter>_<random6>`)
and extracts the owning pid; the golden-template sweep drops any such database
whose owning pid is dead (`isPidAlive` -> ESRCH). This mirrors the template
dead-pid sweep and is safe: the current run's own databases share this live pid,
and a concurrent same-machine run under a different (live) pid is never touched.
Any name that does not match the strict per-file tail (a real Fusion project DB,
or a template) returns null and is left alone.

 * FNXC:SqliteFinalRemoval 2026-06-25-00:00:
 * Shared PostgreSQL test harness mirroring `createSharedTaskStoreTestHarness`
 * from store-test-helpers.ts, but backed by PostgreSQL. This is the migration
 * target for the ~53 core test files that today use the SQLite shared harness.
 *
 * Design — one PG database is created in `beforeAll` and reused across every
 * test in the describe block. `beforeEach` resets state by:
 *   1. TRUNCATE-ing every application table (project/central/archive schemas)
 *      with RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE, so sequences reset and FK chains clear.
 *   2. Resetting the singleton `config` row to DEFAULT_PROJECT_SETTINGS.
 *   3. Clearing the TaskStore's in-memory caches so no cross-test state leaks.
 *
 * This is dramatically faster than `createTaskStoreForTest()` (which creates a
 * fresh database per test) because the expensive CREATE DATABASE + schema apply
 * happens once per file, not once per test.
 *
 * The harness is only usable under `pgDescribe` (auto-skipped when PG is
 * unavailable), so it never breaks the merge gate in CI.
 *
 * Usage (mirrors the SQLite shared harness shape):
 * ```ts
 * import { pgDescribe, createSharedPgTaskStoreTestHarness } from "@fusion/test-utils/pg-test-harness";
 *
 * const pgTest = pgDescribe("my feature (PostgreSQL)");
 *
 * pgTest("does a thing", async () => {
 *   const h = createSharedPgTaskStoreTestHarness();
 *   await h.beforeAll();
 *   try {
 *     await h.beforeEach();
 *     const store = h.store();
 *     // ... exercise the store ...
 *   } finally {
 *     await h.afterEach();
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * For the common `describe` + `beforeAll/beforeEach/afterEach/afterAll` shape
 * that the existing SQLite shared harness uses, the lifecycle hooks wire up
 * directly.

FNXC:PgTestHarnessResetSpeed 2026-08-15-03:52:
Slow-test fix (harness-wide): the per-test reset was a single TRUNCATE ... RESTART
IDENTITY CASCADE over all ~110 application tables. Profiled at 163ms of the 169ms
shared-harness beforeEach (mission-store.pg: 62 tests -> ~10s of pure TRUNCATE),
because TRUNCATE pays a per-table constant (new relfilenode + catalog churn +
fsync) regardless of row count — and in a typical test only a handful of tables
hold rows. Replace it with one DO block that:
  1. switches session_replication_role to 'replica' (transaction-local) so FK
     triggers are inert and deletion order is irrelevant;
  2. DELETEs only tables that actually contain rows (EXISTS probe per table is
     ~0.05ms; empty tables are skipped entirely);
  3. resets EVERY sequence in the three application schemas to its declared
     start value, reproducing RESTART IDENTITY exactly (including sequences
     advanced by insert-then-delete tests whose tables ended empty — the full
     TRUNCATE reset those too, so the sweep must be unconditional).
Observable semantics are identical: every application table is empty and every
identity restarts, so ID-reuse assertions (KB-001) keep holding. The caller
falls back to the legacy full TRUNCATE if this fast path errors (e.g. a
non-superuser test role that may not set session_replication_role).
