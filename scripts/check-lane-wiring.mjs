Ratchet the population of call sites that do not pass a resolved-lane argument. See
scripts/lib/lane-wiring-census.mjs for why this is a census with a baseline and not a hard guard.

Usage:
  node scripts/check-lane-wiring.mjs                     # fail if any file's count ROSE
  node scripts/check-lane-wiring.mjs --update-baseline   # re-record (downward moves only)

`packages/dashboard/app` and `plugins` are scanned, and `.tsx` counts — their absence was the
blind spot the OLDER guard already learned about and this one re-opened.

`unwired-lane-parameter-guard.test.ts` scans exactly six roots including these two, and its note
records why: an unwired `completeColumnsByTaskId` sat on `main` unreported because the glasses plugin
was not in the list. Plugins hold real lane logic — they resolve workflow IRs, filter by column, and
decide what "finished" means — and `dashboard/app` is where the board is actually rendered.

The extension is TWO changes, and either alone still misses most of it: those trees are overwhelmingly
`.tsx`, which the file filter below excluded, so adding the roots without the extension would have
scanned a handful of files and reported a reassuring near-zero.

Measured on the widened scan, re-measured after rebasing onto main: 15 further call sites, none of
which any gate could see before. They are recorded in the baseline rather than fixed here — they span
three other batches — and audited in the PR that widened this, because baselining a site nobody looked
at is how a ratchet becomes decoration.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-23:55 (#2978 review — coderabbitai, "correct the audited
call-site count"): the note said 9 and the review said 10, from the pre-rebase baseline. BOTH are now
wrong: main gained sites in these very trees while the PR sat, so the widening currently uncovers 15.
A hand-written count beside a generated baseline dates the moment it is written — this one is stamped
so the next reader knows to re-measure rather than trust it.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-23:58 (#2978 review — coderabbitai, "fail closed when a
required root cannot be scanned"): AN UNREADABLE ROOT IS A GATE THAT LIES, NOT A GATE THAT PASSES.

`catch { return [] }` turned a missing or unreadable root into an empty file list, so a typo'd path or
a permissions failure produced a smaller scan and a confident `none added`. Every root here is part of
the coverage contract — `plugins` and `dashboard/app` were added BECAUSE they were unscanned — so
silently dropping one restores exactly the blindness this change exists to remove.

Fails closed with the root path in the message. A gate whose errors land on "nothing to report" is the
one failure mode a ratchet must not have.
