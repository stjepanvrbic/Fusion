Both checks ask this task's OWN lanes, because keyed on the literals they fail in BOTH directions.

  `hasDoneTransient` gated on `column === "done"`. On a board whose complete lane is named anything
  else it NEVER fires, so a finished card still carrying `status:"failed"`, a worktree, a blockedBy or
  live recovery counters is never reported and never normalized — the exact stale state FN-4000 exists
  to clear.

  `failed-status-outside-in-review` gated on `column !== "in-review"`, and fails the OPPOSITE way: on a
  renamed board no column equals the literal, so EVERY failed task is flagged. A reconciliation report
  listing the whole board is as useless as one listing nothing, and it is the more dangerous of the
  two because it looks like the tool is working.

Lanes arrive resolved from the caller rather than being resolved here, so this stays pure and testable
without a database or a built dist.

`resolveLanes` is INJECTED, not built here, and `main` below supplies the real one.

Resolving inside this function would drag `importCore()` — and therefore a built `packages/core/dist`
— into every unit test of a pure reconciliation loop. Injection keeps the tests database-free and
build-free while the production entry point still wires a real resolver, which is the wiring that
matters: an optional lane parameter no caller fills is the inert shape this migration keeps finding.
