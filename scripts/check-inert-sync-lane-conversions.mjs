FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-14:10:
BLOCK THE OTHER INERT CONVERSION — a lane guard WIRED to a synchronous resolver that always answers
with the default board.

`check-inert-flag-seams.mjs` catches an optional lane parameter that NO caller supplies. This catches
the opposite shape, which passes that check cleanly: the parameter IS supplied, from a helper that
resolves through `store.resolveTaskWorkflowIrSync`. That reader's selection lookup
(`getTaskWorkflowSelectionImpl`) returns `undefined` unconditionally in PostgreSQL mode — the shipped
backend — so the resolver falls to its `!workflowId` branch and hands back the DEFAULT builtin IR.

Note the shape exactly, because the obvious reading is wrong and it is what makes this invisible: the
helper does NOT receive `undefined` and fall through to a `?? "in-review"` arm. It receives a REAL IR
that resolves REAL traits — the default board's — so it answers with full confidence, and the `??`
fallbacks beside it are dead code. `parked.review` is `"in-review"` for every card on every board.

    tsc passes         the value is a string, correctly typed
    tests pass         on the default board the constant answer IS the right answer
    the census DROPS   it counts comparisons against string literals, and the literal really is gone

So every instrument scores it as a win while the guard behaves exactly as the literal did. That is
worse than leaving the literal, because the literal was COUNTED and this is not.

NOT HYPOTHETICAL, AND PROSE DID NOT HOLD IT. `executor.ts:10459` states this finding in full, dated
2026-07-30, calling it "the most important finding in this sweep". The next day PR #3051 converted ten
`scheduler.ts` handler arms in exactly this way; the census fell by ten and no behaviour changed on any
board (refuted live in
`packages/engine/src/__tests__/workflow-scheduler-sync-role-conversion-inert-live-e2e.pg.test.ts`).
A comment cannot fail a build. This can.

WHAT IT CHECKS. Per file: functions whose body reaches `resolveTaskWorkflowIrSync` and that hand back
column ids ("sync lane sources"), the locals assigned from them, and the `===`/`!==` guards that
consume those locals' role fields. The per-file count is baselined and a RISE fails.

SCHEDULER 20 -> 18, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A RETIREMENT (2026-07-31-20:30). #3065 replaced three
`to === parked.complete || to === parked.archived` pairs with three `parked.terminal.has(to)` calls.
Six comparison sites became three membership sites, so the COUNT fell while the guards themselves are
unchanged and all three remain counted (#3068 taught this check to see `.has`). Verified before
re-recording, because from inside this check a fall caused by denser encoding is indistinguishable
from a fall caused by a gate being deleted — and only the second is a defect. That check is the
standing obligation attached to every `--update-baseline`.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-08-01-05:01:
FN-8656 re-records the scheduler drop because it removes the inert sync-lane source entirely, not
because it deletes this guard. The synchronous prologue now uses emitter lanes and every await-safe
arm resolves asynchronously, so there are no sync-derived scheduler guards left to census.

WHY A RISE AND NOT ZERO. Existing sync-resolved guards are real, deliberate, and documented — the
scheduler's listeners genuinely cannot await today, and their authors said so. Demanding zero would
force either a revert or an exemption marker on day one. What must not happen is MORE literals
quietly becoming inert-resolved, which is precisely the fleet-phase failure. A drop is welcome and
re-records with `--update-baseline`.

CROSS-MODULE SOURCES ARE FOLLOWED (2026-07-31-19:05). The first two versions collected sync-lane
sources PER FILE, so a helper defined in one module and consumed in another was invisible. That limit
stopped being theoretical: `resolvePlannerLanes` lives in `replan-target.ts` and is consumed in
`triage.ts` and `executor.ts`, and `triage.ts:723` already reads
`task.column === disposeLanes.hold || ... || task.column === "in-progress"` — a sync-resolved pair
sitting beside a literal, i.e. a site a fleet worker would reach for next, whose "conversion" would be
inert and which this check could not have seen.

So sources are now collected in a FIRST PASS over the whole tree, and consumption is counted in a
second pass against that repo-wide set.

LIMITS, STATED SO NOBODY OVER-TRUSTS IT. Sources are still matched by function NAME, not by resolved
symbol, so two unrelated functions sharing a name are conflated — the same caveat
`check-inert-flag-seams.mjs` records. It proves a guard consumes a sync-resolved answer, not that the
answer is wrong for every caller. Treat a report as a pointer to investigate. Tests are excluded.

TO CLEAR A FAILURE: resolve asynchronously (thread the lane in from a caller that has already awaited
a store read), or carry the resolved lanes on the event payload so no listener resolves at all. Do NOT
add the site to the baseline to make the build pass — that is the same false green one layer up.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-31-23:59 (the check evaded its own check, SECOND shape):
THE INITIALIZER IS NOT ALWAYS THE CALL.

This registered a local only when the initializer WAS a call expression. The correct
payload-first/sync-fallback shape puts the call inside a conditional:

    const sync = moveLanes ? undefined : resolvePlannerLanes(this.store, taskId);
    const hold = moveLanes?.hold ?? sync?.hold ?? "todo";

`sync` was never registered, so its guards were never counted. MEASURED: writing `executor.ts` in
exactly that shape took it from 4 counted guards to ZERO while the sync resolver was still there and
still answering with the default board whenever the payload is absent.

That is the same class of evasion the note below records for the inline spelling, and it matters more
here because the shape it misses is the RECOMMENDED one — a fallback to the sync resolver is better
than a fallback to legacy literals, so authors are actively steered toward the form the scan cannot
see. A ratchet that goes quiet exactly when the code is written well is worse than no ratchet.

Conditionals and `??`/`||` chains are now unwrapped, so any branch containing a sync source registers
the local. Still a NAME match, not dataflow — the limits section above still applies.

One hop was not enough. The real shape in `executor.ts` rebuilds the lanes into a fresh object before
comparing, so the sync local never appears in a guard:

    const sync  = payload ? undefined : resolvePlannerLanes(this.store, taskId);
    const lanes = { hold: payload?.hold ?? sync?.hold ?? "todo", … };
    if (from !== lanes.hold && from !== lanes.intake) return false;

`sync` is registered, `lanes` is not, and every guard reads `lanes`. MEASURED: `executor.ts` reported
ZERO counted guards while the sync resolver was still present.

So a local built from an object literal that mentions a sync local is itself a sync local. Iterated to
a fixpoint because the laundering can chain (`a -> b -> c`); a single pass catches only the first link.

DELIBERATELY NOT full dataflow: `const` object construction only — no function returns, no
cross-module spread, no reassignment. The LIMITS section above still governs.

  FALSE  name `sync` builds `\bsync\b`, which DOES match inside `$sync` — `$` is a non-word character,

A CORRECTION TO AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS NOTE, which claimed `_sync` also fails: it does not.
`_` IS a word character, so `\b_sync\b` matches `_sync` correctly. Checked rather than reasoned
about, after asserting the opposite here without checking.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:35:
AN UNRECORDED DROP NOW FAILS, matching the sibling ratchet `check-lane-wiring.mjs`.

This warned and exited 0, which left the allowance stale-high and the ratchet SLACK. Measured, and
the example is mine: #3065 replaced three `to === parked.complete || to === parked.archived` guards
with `parked.terminal.has(to)` and took the count 20 -> 18. I did not re-record, nothing failed, and
`main` then carried a baseline of 20 against a real count of 18 — TWO FREE SLOTS in the gate whose
entire purpose is to stop this class growing. Someone could add two new inert conversions and the
build would stay green.

A ratchet that only tightens on request does not ratchet. `check-lane-wiring` already exits 1 here
and says why; this is the same rule for the same reason, so the two gates cannot drift in how
seriously they take their own ledger.

NOT EVERY RATCHET SHOULD DO THIS, and the counter-example is worth naming so nobody "fixes" it to
match. `check-fnxc-future-dates` deliberately AUTO-TIGHTENS and exits 0, because its population moves
on its own: "is this stamp in the future" is answered against TODAY, so every date boundary the runner
crosses converts future stamps into past ones and the count falls with NO code change and NO author to
fix it. Drop-fails there guarantees a red gate on some later day, and did.

The distinction is whether a drop has an AUTHOR. This count only moves when someone edits a guard, so
