backend (scripts/lib/backend-db.mjs). The planning logic is pure
(planReconcileLeakedSoftDeletes) so tests exercise it with plain row arrays;
only the thin apply step touches PostgreSQL. Behavior preserved from FN-5175:
soft-deleted rows leaked outside 'archived' are moved to 'archived' with a
run-audit event per repaired row.

`archivedLanes` is the board's OWN archived vocabulary, and it decides what counts as "leaked".

Keyed on the literal, this filter calls a soft-deleted row leaked whenever its column is not the
string `archived` — so on a board whose archived lane is named anything else EVERY soft-deleted row
looks leaked, and `--apply` then rewrites all of them. The repair is the damage: see the write step.

A row already resting in ANY of the board's archived lanes is not leaked, which is why the filter
takes the SET rather than a single id. The WRITE resolves per task instead — see `reconcileLeakedSoftDeletes`.

FNXC:OperatorScriptLaneAssumptions 2026-07-30-23:50:
The repair writes each task's OWN archived lane, and REFUSES to guess when it cannot resolve one.

This wrote the literal: `UPDATE project."tasks" SET "column" = 'archived'`. On a board that does not
declare `archived` that is not a mislabel — it parks the row in a column the workflow does not have,
manufacturing exactly the undeclared-column state this migration keeps repairing elsewhere, and it
did so under `--apply` against an operator's live database.

The SQL pre-filter went with it. It carried the same literal (`AND "column" != 'archived'`), so the
query and the planner each imposed the legacy vocabulary and fixing only one would leave the other
silently deciding. Soft-deleted rows are a small set, so selecting them all and filtering in the
planner costs nothing and leaves ONE place that decides what "archived" means.

A row whose own archived lane cannot be resolved is SKIPPED and reported, never written with a
guessed id. A recovery script that declines to act on the rows it does not understand is recoverable;
one that writes a plausible wrong value is not.

Verified rather than assumed: a store that answers nothing resolves to the default lifecycle
(`archived: "archived"`), so a legacy board still repairs exactly as before.
