Issue #2862 observed suite-only PostgreSQL-adjacent flakes in files with substantial remaining coverage, so the AGENTS.md first-sighting exception authorizes a record instead of a file-level quarantine. This test prevents dangling paths, suite-title drift, and silent removal of that narrow policy or its evidence requirements.

FN-9146 requires the register's active statuses to name the current evidence owner after a completed campaign. Enforce the stated count, retained observation state, ownership, and inbound testing-guide anchors so that decision surface cannot silently drift.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-08-30-04:25:
A closed record may stay PHYSICALLY inside the active section when later evidence still cross-references it: entry 7 was closed on 2026-08-23 after its file was quarantined, but the FN-9146 campaign-evidence assertion below reads its per-run table in place, so relocating it to the archive would destroy that coverage. The stated introduction count describes ACTIVE records only, so closed-status entries are excluded here rather than moved. Counting raw sections instead made the two disagree the moment entry 7 closed and left main red. Drift protection is unchanged: the pinned list below still fixes every active heading and its exact status text.
*/
/*
FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-03-22:23:
The register now records that evidence owner FN-9146 was archived on 2026-09-03 without a named
successor, so active records 1 and 2 are unowned pending their next sighting. The pinned status
texts below track that archived-owner annotation; do not strip it without re-homing the records.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-09-13:51:
FN-9283 closed entry 14 by deleting stale FN-6735 coverage that asserted FN-217-removed automatic
review-to-WIP recovery. The active inventory must exclude the archived record, so a future quarantine
is never mistaken for an unresolved deletion-ratchet obligation.

FNXC:WorkflowResultsTabMocks 2026-09-20-09:58:
FN-9336 closed entry 15 after request-aware selector fixtures proved the whole file and its exact
preserved-column reproduction green. The record stays physically in the active section for first-sighting
evidence, while this active inventory must include only entries 2 and 13.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-10-19:28:
Entry 14 closed 2026-09-09 when the deletion ratchet executed via commit 55912bd665, which
removed the test file, the quarantine ledger entry, and the engine-reliability exclude in one
commit. The register record now keeps its historical identity on relabeled File/Exact-test
lines that no longer match the dangling-path scan (the file no longer exists to drift-check),
and identifies the required successor without making the archived path active.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-13-10:38:
FN-9297 replaces the ghost FN-9287 hand-off and delivers deterministic FN-6735 unit coverage in
merge-pause-abort-recovery.test.ts. The archived entry remains outside active-record validation,
while its successor reference makes the deletion-ratchet closure auditable.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-12-04:32:
Entry 1 closed 2026-09-12: FN-9131's structural harness connection-budget fix (ae507afc37,
merged 2026-08-16) resolved its reproduced project-identity timeout with loaded re-measurement
green, and no sighting has occurred since. The status line now starts with "Closed", so the
active list drops to entries 2 and 13 and the stated count drops to 2. Entry 1's record and
its FN-9146 campaign table stay physically in the active section (readActiveRecordSections
does not filter by status), so the campaign-evidence assertion below still reads entry 1 in
place — keep it in expectedSubjectResults exactly like the closed-in-place entry 7.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-24-19:55:
FN-9389 adds entry 17 after a one-time Full Suite terminal graph-gate mismatch. Its source and
outbox trace establishes no product race, so pin the active inventory and require its next
sighting to follow the file-level quarantine policy without weakening the durable contract.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-29-07:58:
FN-9419 records a second sighting of entry 17, so the deletion ratchet moves it from the active
first-sighting inventory to the archive. Preserve both run identifiers, the exact test identity,
and the quarantined status as behavioral evidence without weakening the outbox assertion.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-09-24-22:49:
FN-9390 records the triage retry warning as a high-value first sighting after source tracing
showed a fake-timer observation race rather than a production retry defect. Keep its active
status pinned so a repeat executes the file-level quarantine rule without weakening the warning.

FNXC:SkillsGetFlakeRegister 2026-09-29-14:00:
FN-9423 records one built CLI completion timeout only after the real built-entry file test passed.
The active inventory and evidence check keep the second-sighting quarantine decision tied to the
exact global-flag child lifecycle without widening its existing test budget.

FNXC:TriagePlanningRetry 2026-10-05-04:34:
FN-9498 closed entry 18 after the shard logs proved an abandoned fake-timer test was consuming
its successor's mocks. Keep the active inventory and retained evidence separate: the closed record
must preserve both test identities and the synchronization repair without authorizing quarantine.

FNXC:AgentSkillDetailOrdering 2026-10-05-08:54:
FN-9506 records the shard-three Agent Detail badge observation after a controlled pending-discovery
repair. Keep the first-sighting record active so a second appearance follows the file-level
quarantine rule rather than silently treating a deterministic test repair as a policy exemption.

FNXC:TestFlakeRegister 2026-10-08-04:50:
Entry 28 was sighted a second time on the fork's Full Suite, so the deletion ratchet moves it from the
active first-sighting inventory to the archive. The archived record must keep both run identifiers, the
unchanged assertion text, and the product-race lead so a rescue starts from the executor rather than a timeout.
