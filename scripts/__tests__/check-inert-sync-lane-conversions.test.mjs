// Exit-code coverage for the inert-sync-lane ratchet: a RISE fails, and an unrecorded DROP fails too.
/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:45:
A RATCHET THAT ONLY TIGHTENS ON REQUEST DOES NOT RATCHET, and nothing tested this one's exit codes.

The rise path was always an error. The DROP path only warned and exited 0, which leaves the
allowance stale-high and the gate slack by exactly the size of the drop.

Measured, and the example is mine: #3065 replaced three
`to === parked.complete || to === parked.archived` guards with `parked.terminal.has(to)` and took the
count 20 -> 18. I did not re-record, nothing failed, and `main` then carried a baseline of 20 against
a real count of 18 — two free slots in the gate whose whole purpose is to stop this class growing.
Two new inert conversions would have passed.

Its sibling `check-lane-wiring.mjs` already exits 1 on an unrecorded drop and says why. These two
gates guard the same program and must not disagree about how seriously they take their own ledger.

Driven by RUNNING the script against a temp baseline, not by importing a helper: the exit code IS the
contract — a version that printed the right warning and still exited 0 would satisfy any assertion
about its output.

THE INITIALIZER IS NOT ALWAYS THE CALL — the shape that evaded this gate, now pinned.

`syncLaneLocals` registered a local only when its initializer WAS a call expression, so the
payload-first/sync-fallback form slipped past entirely:

    const sync = payload ? undefined : localSync(store, id);
    return column === sync?.hold;          // inert, and counted as nothing

That matters more than the inline spelling the header already covers, because this shape is the one
authors are STEERED toward: falling back to the sync resolver is better than falling back to legacy
literals (it is best-effort under legacy SQLite; a literal can never be right on a renamed board), so
writing the guard well is what made it invisible. A ratchet that goes quiet exactly when the code
improves is worse than none.

Driven through a real file in the scanned tree rather than a unit call, because the bug was in which
nodes the scan VISITS — a helper-level assertion would have been written against the same wrong
mental model that produced the gap.

The two-hop form this case originally listed as an open gap — sync local -> object literal ->
comparison — is covered by the chained case below; the gap was closed in the same branch.

THE SECOND HOP, which the case above explicitly left open.

A sync local laundered through an object literal reached the guards while the scan saw nothing:

    const sync  = payload ? undefined : localSync(store, id);
    const lanes = { hold: payload?.hold ?? sync?.hold ?? "todo" };
    if (from !== lanes.hold) …            // inert, counted as nothing

`executor.ts` is written exactly this way, and MEASURED it reported ZERO counted guards while the
sync resolver was still present and still answering with the default board whenever the payload is
absent. With the fix that file reports 2 — the two guards that genuinely remain after its dead
helper is deleted.

The chained case is in the probe on purpose: laundering can go `a -> b -> c`, and a single pass
would catch only the first link. That is the same one-pass mistake this file's earlier cases record,
made twice already in this scanner.

uncounted, which is the exact failure this scanner exists to prevent. `_sync` is wrong for the

Propagation is PER PROPERTY, and these are the negative cases that prove it.

Marking a whole object sync-derived because its text mentioned a local counted guards that read a
sibling LITERAL (`{ hold: sync?.hold, review: "todo" }` made `lanes.review` inert) and matched a
local's NAME appearing as a KEY (`{ sync: "todo" }`) without anything reading it.

Over-counting is not the safe direction for this gate. It inflates the baseline — so the allowance
absorbs real inert conversions later — and it trains readers to skip the report, which this
program's learnings record as exactly how the next genuine finding gets missed.
