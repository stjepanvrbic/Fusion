FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-30-23:50:
BLOCK NEW INERT CONVERSIONS — an optional trailing lane/flag parameter that no caller supplies.

The lifecycle-column program replaces `column === "done"` with a resolved-role read. A conversion
that adds the parameter and never wires a caller is WORSE than the literal:

  tsc passes        the parameter is optional, so omitting it is legal
  tests pass        the fallback IS the old behaviour — that is what the fallback is for
  the census DROPS  it counts comparisons, and the literal really is gone

So the instrument measuring the program scores the broken version as a win. Measured rate when this
check was written: five of nine conversions in one reviewed-and-green tranche were inert.

WHAT IT CHECKS. Exported functions whose LAST parameter is optional and named like resolved lanes
(`columnFlags`, `lifecycleColumns`, `reviewColumns`, `displayColumnOptions`, ...). At least one call site must pass that many
arguments. Component props are covered separately by
`packages/dashboard/app/__tests__/resolved-flags-seams-have-suppliers.test.ts`.

LIMITS, STATED SO NOBODY OVER-TRUSTS IT. Relative imports and local shadows resolve to the declaring
module, but unresolved calls remain a conservative name match; treat a report as a pointer to
investigate, never as a diff to apply. Tests are tracked separately from production so test-only
suppliers cannot clear a seam. It proves a caller passes SOMETHING in that position, not that the
value is correct or non-undefined. Cheap half of the question; it is the half that was silently wrong.

TO CLEAR A FAILURE: wire a supplier, or delete the parameter and leave the literal counted. Adding an
allow-list entry is the last resort and needs the reason spelled out.

`plugins/` IS SCANNED, because plugins hold real lane logic and this gate could not see any of it.

The walk was rooted at `packages/` alone. Measured with a control: the identical unwired seam is
caught under `packages/` and MISSED under `plugins/` — so every lane parameter a plugin declares or
calls was outside the ratchet entirely.

Not hypothetical. `plugins/fusion-plugin-even-realities-glasses` resolves workflow IRs and filters by
column in `src/cards.ts` and `src/routes/board-routes.ts`. The sibling `check-lane-wiring` already
lists `plugins` in its roots, and its header records the incident that put it there: an unwired
`completeColumnsByTaskId` sat on `main` unreported because that plugin was not scanned. This gate
re-opened the same hole rather than learning from it.

Found while auditing my own gates after #3000 showed this one never scanned `scripts/` either. Two
scope holes in one instrument is a pattern: the roots deserve the same scrutiny as the matcher, and
they had none.

PASSING `undefined` FOR THE LANE ANSWER IS NOT SUPPLYING IT.

The seam is a trailing optional parameter, so this gate asked how many ARGUMENTS each call site
passes. A call that spells the omission out —

    resolveSomething("KB-1", undefined)

— satisfies that count while the callee receives exactly what it received before: nothing. The
parameter is still inert and the board still reads the legacy vocabulary.

That spelling is not exotic. It is what a partial wiring-up produces when the flags are threaded
through an intermediate that has none to pass, and what a mechanical edit produces when it fills
argument slots positionally. Either way the gate reported the seam as answered.

Missed by BOTH gates: check-lane-wiring (#2966) covers the default-valued and options-object shapes
this one is structurally blind to, but it counts arguments the same way here. Found by probing my own
gate with shapes I had not designed it for — the discipline argued for in #2979.

TRAILING ONLY. A middle `undefined` still positions the arguments after it, so those are real answers.

supplied all five through an alias; the other had it red on main over two call sites that are

are the kind of rule whose breakage reads as the gate merely having an opinion, which is how a guard
