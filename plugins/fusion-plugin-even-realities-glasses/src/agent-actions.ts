FNXC:PluginLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-03:20 (U11 #2515 audit):
Is the card in its workflow's PRE-IMPLEMENTATION lane — intake or hold?

These gates named `triage` directly. U11 merged Todo into Planning keeping the id
`todo` and DELETING `triage`, so on the default lineage `approvePlan` refused every
card (an awaiting-approval card now sits in `todo`) and `retryTask`'s planning branch
became unreachable. `startWork` survived only because it already accepted both ids —
which is the tell: the gate written against a lane kept working, the two written
against an id broke.

Resolves the task's OWN lanes when the host store can (this plugin depends on
`@fusion/core`), and falls back to BOTH legacy ids when it cannot. The fallback is
not cosmetic: `PluginContext["taskStore"]` is a narrowed surface and is not
guaranteed to expose workflow selection, so a plugin must degrade to something that
works rather than to something that refuses.

  PROVE THE READ, DO NOT CHECK THE IR'S IDENTITY. My previous revision required the resolved IR to
  identify as the selected workflow id. A persisted custom workflow's stored IR usually carries NO `id`
  and its `name` is a DISPLAY name ("Six Column Shape"), not the selection id ("wf_7") — so the check
  marked every valid custom board degraded and refused every action on it. Strictly worse than the
  laundering it was meant to stop: that was a wrong answer in a rare case, this was a refusal in the
  common one.

  My own test passed because the fixture's IR happened to carry `id: "wf-custom"`, matching its
  selection id. A fixture coincidence standing in for the property under test — the same failure this
  PR has already documented twice.

  What I actually need is proof the DEFINITION READ SUCCEEDED, not proof of identity:
    - CUSTOM selection: `getWorkflowDefinition(id)` must return a row with an `ir`. A missing row or a
      throw is the state `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` papers over with the default IR, and it is the only
      thing that can silently substitute another board's vocabulary.
    - BUILTIN selection: resolves through the in-process catalog, so there is no read to fail — but an
      UNKNOWN builtin id would fall back to the default, so the id must actually be a builtin.
    - NO selection: nothing to mismatch. The default IS the answer, and refusing here would break every
      board that has never had a workflow explicitly selected.

      A STORED STRING IR COSTS A SECOND READ, so the lanes can come from a different revision than the
      degraded verdict — the drift the surrounding comment claims to have removed. My earlier excuse for
      it ("deliberate and confined to that shape") was not a reason.

      I tried `parseWorkflowIr(definition.ir)` to keep it to one read. The parse succeeds in isolation and
      `resolveLifecycleColumns` returns the right roles for the parsed IR (verified directly), but the
      action still refused in the plugin harness, so something between the parse and the lane check
      differs from the resolver path and I could not identify it here. Shipping an unexplained change into
      the code path that decides whether an operator's action is REFUSED trades a bounded drift window for
      an unbounded one, so the second read stays — named rather than excused.

      The window is small and its failure mode is safe: it needs a workflow edit between two reads
      microseconds apart, and the result is a refusal or a stale lane set, never a move onto another
