# FNXC:DockerBuild 2026-08-17-23:18: The dashboard's `vite build` transforms ~5.7k modules and

# build with "FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit" (exit 134). The ceiling is
# a cap, not a reservation — V8 only grows to what the build needs — so raising it here costs
# nothing on larger hosts and is the difference between a working and a failing `docker build`
# on a default install. Scoped to this RUN so it never leaks into the runner stage's env.

# FNXC:DockerRun 2026-08-18-05:35: ca-certificates is REQUIRED, not optional hardening. The slim
# base ships zero CA certificates, and git verifies TLS against the SYSTEM store — so every HTTPS
# clone failed with "server certificate verification failed. CAfile: none CRLfile: none", which
# breaks project setup outright (operator report). It hid behind Node, which carries its own bundled
# CA store: the dashboard, model APIs, and OAuth token exchanges all worked, so the image looked
# healthy right up until the first clone.
# FNXC:DockerRun 2026-08-18-06:05: ripgrep ships by default because the coding agents Fusion drives
# reach for `rg` as their primary search tool; without it they silently degrade to slower/partial
# fallbacks inside the container while working fine on a developer machine that has it installed.
# FNXC:DockerRun 2026-08-20-04:30: git-lfs ships by default because this repository stores binary
# assets (screenshots) as LFS objects. Without it, git silently checks out 130-byte POINTER FILES
# instead of the real content and reports a clean tree — so an agent reads a text stub where an image
# should be, and `git lfs` subcommands in any workflow fail outright. It is a git dependency, not an
# optional extra: the failure is silent corruption of a working checkout, not a missing feature.

# FNXC:DockerRun 2026-08-18-06:40: gh, tailscale, and cloudflared ship in the image.
# Rationale per tool: `gh` backs Fusion's GitHub integration (githubAuthMode "gh-cli" is a documented
# option and the auth route tells operators to run `gh auth login`, which is impossible if the binary
# is absent); `cloudflared` backs the dashboard's remote-access feature, whose installer cannot
# bootstrap itself reliably inside a slim container; `tailscale` gives the same box a private-network
# option. All three come from their vendors' own apt repositories with signed keyrings rather than
# curl-to-shell installers, so upgrades and signature checks follow the normal apt path.
#
# NOTE: installing tailscale does NOT make `tailscaled` runnable by itself — the daemon additionally
# needs `--cap-add NET_ADMIN --device /dev/net/tun` on `docker run`. Shipping the binary is the part
# the image can own; granting kernel capabilities stays an explicit operator decision.
#
# FNXC:DockerRun 2026-08-27-20:00: google-chrome-stable joins them, because the image shipped NO
# browser at all and two shipped features silently need one. `plugins/fusion-plugin-agent-browser`
# drives a browser through `playwright-core`, which by design does NOT download one at install time
# (`src/driver.ts`), and probes fixed paths whose first two Linux entries are `/usr/bin/google-chrome`
# and `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable` (`src/probe.ts`). The Chrome DevTools MCP server
# (`chrome-devtools-mcp`) likewise launches an EXISTING Chrome and downloads nothing; with no browser
# present it fails every call with "Could not find Google Chrome executable for channel 'stable'".
# Google Chrome stable is chosen over Debian's `chromium` because it is the only browser
# chrome-devtools-mcp officially supports (its README supports Chrome and Chrome for Testing only,
# and treats other Chromium builds as unsupported), and Google publishes it for BOTH amd64 and arm64,
# so `arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)` resolves on either host. Measured 2026-08-27 in the stable
# repo index: google-chrome-stable 152.0.7977.64-1 for amd64 and arm64.
#
# NOTE: shipping the binary does not make Chrome's own sandbox usable. Chrome sandboxes itself with
# unprivileged user namespaces, which the default container seccomp profile blocks — `unshare -U`
# returns EPERM here even though the kernel allows namespaces (max_user_namespaces=126143), and
# Chrome then aborts at startup with "No usable sandbox!". Callers must therefore either pass
# `--no-sandbox` (chrome-devtools-mcp: `--chromeArg=--no-sandbox`) or the operator must relax the
# profile at `docker run` with `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`. Same division of responsibility
# as tailscale above: the image owns the binary, kernel privileges stay an operator decision.

# and stopped there with nothing in the UI to explain why (operator report).
#
# The values match the identity Fusion already uses for its own fence commits, so authorship stays
# consistent; an operator who wants real authorship overrides it with `git config --global` in a
# mounted home or a derived image. This is a FALLBACK for the container, not a substitute for
# passing an explicit identity at the commit sites — those should still be fixed upstream so a bare

# `docker stop` still shuts down gracefully and a crash still ends the container with its real status.
# `--from-source` (or FUSION_FROM_SOURCE=1) runs the CLI from the FUSION_SOURCE_ROOT git checkout
